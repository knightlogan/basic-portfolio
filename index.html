                        My name is Logan Knight.  I was born in Memphis, TN but have lived in North Carolina for most of my life.  I received my undergraduate degree form
                        Appalachian State University and my MBA from East Carolina University.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love the outdoors and when I was 26 I went to live in New Zealand and Australia
                        for 3 years.  After that I returned back to North Carolina to finish my degree.

                        I moved to Raleigh from Denver, CO where I worked as a tax analyst and snowboard instructor.  During the summers I would also work as a bike mechanic and mountain bike instructor.

                        I grew up playing all different kind of sports, but my favorite was always football and boxing.  My dad and I have had season tickets to the Carolina Panthers
                        since their first year in 1995.

                       <strong>I recently got engaged to my beautiful fiance, Jennifer</strong>; so when I'm not working or going to class I'm spending time with her and my 5 year old chocolate lab who loves to swim in Falls Lake.
